======INFO========================================
This is a simple Pythagorean Theorem Calculator
I wrote in Python. It calculates using the normal
a² + b² = c² formula, and automatically rounds the
C value to only contain TWO decimal places.

I am a 15 year old high-school sophomore at the 
time of writing this, and I enjoy programming 
different things. You can find more info about me 
on my personal README file here on GitHub.
